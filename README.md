## Inspiration

I’ve always wanted a place online that truly feels like me, not just a LinkedIn profile or a PDF résumé. After months of sketches, experiments, and learning, I finally built my first real portfolio website!

## What I Focused On

- Clean, intuitive design
- Smooth navigation across devices
- A layout that doesn’t just work, but feels good to use

Every pixel and decision had a reason behind it, and I spent a lot of time making sure it wasn’t just functional but enjoyable too.

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me level up in:

- Responsive design
- Front-end development techniques
- Attention to detail, like spacing, typography, and accessibility

It was also a great exercise in translating abstract ideas into real, interactive components.

## The Website

This is just version 1, but it’s a solid start.
Inside, you’ll find:

- My résumé
- Highlights of my projects and skills
- A peek into what excites me beyond code

Take a look around, I’d love to hear what you think.
